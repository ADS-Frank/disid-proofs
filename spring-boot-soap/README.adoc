= SOAP service using CXF and JAX-WS 

These proof of concepts show you how to configure an Spring Boot application to provide SOAP Services using Apache CXF and JAX-WS. 

When creating Web services, there are two development styles: Contract Last and Contract First. When using a contract-last approach, you start with the Java code, and let the Web service contract (WSDL file) be generated from that. When using contract-first, you start with the WSDL contract, and use Java to implement said contract. 

Show *Contract-first* proof of concept if you are interested on the contract first web service development style or *Contract-last* proof of concept if you are interested on the contract last web service development style. Both of them include its own `README` file.
