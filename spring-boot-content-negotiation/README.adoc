= Spring Boot Content Negotiation example

Proof of concept that shows how to use Content-Negotation in Spring Boot
application.

Content-Negotiation is useful to deal with multiple representations (or views) 
of the same data returned by the controller. Working out which data format to
return is called Content Negotiation.

The main benefit of the content negotiation is it avoids duplicated logic.

== Setting up the build environment

Just import this project as "External Maven project" in STS 3.7

== Test

commands you should run manually in order to test each handler method.
