= Spring Boot Weblogic 12c

Proof of concept to test Spring Boot app deployment in Weblogic 12.2.1. with TracEE

This PoC solves the issue 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34525967/spring-boot-exception-could-not-open-servletcontext-resource-web-inf-dispatch[Spring Boot exception: Could not open ServletContext resource]
and make an example of use of TracEE

== Setting up the build environment

Import this project as "External Maven project" in STS 3.7.

== Run Tests

Web integration tests have been developed for testing purposes, take a look to
_src/test/java_.

To execute these tests just run JUnit from the STS or `mvn test` from
your favorite shell.

== Test Case

* The property `dummy.type` is in _src/main/resources/application.properties_ 

* Set the JNDI attribute `java:comp/env/DUMMY_TYPE`, via an `env-entry` in the
  _web.xml_ file.

=== Expected results

The attribute `type` of the returned `Account` should have a value
equal to the value of the JNDI attribute `java:comp/env/DUMMY_TYPE`

Show in log messages the invocation id for each call:

* In testHome() calls twice the method getAccount() and you can see that each one has a different 'invocationId' value.

* In testHome2() calls the method getAccount2() and this puts a variable inside 'backend' before to call the findOne() method
