= Spring Roo Proof - Detail inside fragment

This proof has been developed to analyze the best way to include a detail in *list.html*.

* Spring Roo 2.0.0.M2 includes the detail inside the *list.html* directly.

* This proof modifies Spring Roo 2.0.0.M2 html generation to include the detail inside a thymeleaf fragment and then, include the fragment inside the *list.html*
