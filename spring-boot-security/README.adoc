= Spring Boot Application with Spring Security

Proof of concept that shows how to include Spring Security and its _@Configuration_ classes to the generated Spring Boot application.

It's based on a *petclinic* application generated using *Spring Roo 2.0.0.M2*.

== Setting up the build environment

. Import this project as "External Maven project" in STS 3.8+

== Running the application

. Execute `mvn clean compile spring-boot:run` command or run it from STS as Spring Boot application

. Access to http://localhost:8080 

. Check that when you try to access, a login page appears.
